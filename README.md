## Wisdom of the ancients

* When adding new inputs to repeating sections name **and** type (e.g. text) of input fields is critical for that data to be persisted.
* input names **are** carried over between repeating fields so if the same attr is used in two places they will share the same information (change 1 you change the other, delete 1 you delete the other).
